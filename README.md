# Debian package for DisplayLink Linux driver

This is a repack of [DisplayLink official Ubuntu driver](http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu), in `deb` format.

This package should be used with [evdi-dkms](https://github.com/zhsj/evdi) package.

The `DisplayLinkManager` binary is extracted from the official Ubuntu driver, the version for Ubuntu 16.04. And it
is tested with Debian Stretch.
